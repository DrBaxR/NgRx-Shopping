# What is this?
A basic example of a shopping list application made using NgRx.

# Who made this?
**NOT ME!** I just followed [this](https://developer.school/introduction-to-ngrx-store/) and [this](https://developer.school/introduction-to-ngrx-effects/) articles made by [Paul Halliday](https://twitter.com/PaulHalliday_io), which are tutorials about @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects. I just replaced the ```@Effect``` decorators with the ```createEffect()``` fucntion, since the decorators were were deprecated.

# What can I find here?
Two tags: 
- one for an example of using @ngrx/store (simple)
- one for an example of using @ngrx/effects (a bit more complicated)

# What can't I find here?
Anything that does not appear in the _**What can I find here?**_ section.

# Why does this exist?
Idk ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, i just wanted to throw this on Github, since i am 100% sure that if i keep this repo locally i am going to lose it (also, it might help someone; _who knows?_).
